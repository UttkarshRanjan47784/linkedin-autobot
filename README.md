# LinkedIn Autobot!

I want to present to you my second Chrome Extension! üöÄ

- When you visit your My Network page, with mere two clicks you can send connection requests to all people in your recommendation page!! (Only the people whose info is loaded in your browser tab)

- Not only that! If you are in your feed or in your connection's all posts page, with mere two clicks again, you can like üëç all the posts! (This likes all the posts that were loaded in your browser. If you don't want to like all the posts, don't scroll down too much! Usually LinkedIn loads 5 to 8 posts at a time.)

- Tech used : JavaScript, Manifest V3, Chrome API
